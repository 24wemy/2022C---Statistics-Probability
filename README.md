# 2022C---Statistics-Probability | Ogi Wemy

This is a task that I made while taking the parallel C statistics and probability class at Klabat University. 
The source code for this was written or created using the Python programming language,
with Spyder as the text editor. If you have any difficulties with this code, 
you can contact me anytime. 

                                        Thank you!!!"
